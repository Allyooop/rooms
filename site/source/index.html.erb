              <h3 class="question">How long can I stay?</h3>
              <p>Your stay will be expected to be overnight only. You will need to check out of the room by 2pm on the following day.</p>
              <p>If clinical circumstances mean that your stay in hospital for more than one night you will have to move to the normal ward as you and your baby need to be medically fit to remain in these rooms.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Can I pre-book a Woodland Room?</h3>
              <p>It is not possible to book a room in advance of the birth because your clinical condition and that of your baby will need to be assessed before a decision is made as to your suitability to be in a self-contained room. However, once your suitability has been assessed please ask your midwife if there is a room available for you to use.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How will my birth experience impact on my suitability for a Woodland Room?</h3>
              <p>If you give birth by caesarean section or have experienced any complications either prior to, during, or following the birth of your baby you will need to be cared for in the ward area. This will also include if your baby requires any specific treatment or observations. Ask your midwife about your suitability to use a Woodland Room when you have given birth.</p>

              <p>Your partner will be offered breakfast in the room, and can access the tea and coffee making facilities. There is a coffee shop within the Jessop Wing for all other meals and snacks which your partner might want to purchase.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Can my other children stay?</h3>
              <p>We are sorry but other children cannot stay overnight in a Woodland Room. However, your children can visit you in the Room. If your partner is staying with you, please make arrangements for them to leave with a responsible adult at the end of vising time.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Your partner's attire</h3>
              <p>As you would expect your partner will need to wear appropriate clothes while staying in the Woodlands Rooms, as staff will need to care for you during your stay and will be coming into the Rooms to do so. Please make sure you both bring in appropriate comfortable clothing.</p>
