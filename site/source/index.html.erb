          <p>Recent feedback has suggested that some families would like to have the option to pay for a room where their partner could also stay overnight with them when their baby is born.
This facility (often called amenity rooms) is available in most maternity units around the country in other NHS organisations. We have listened to that feedback and the Woodland Rooms at Jessop Wing is the culmination of that feedback.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How long can I stay?</h3>
              <p>Your stay will be expected to be overnight only. You will need to check out of the room by 2pm on the following day.</p>
              <p>If clinical circumstances mean that your stay in hospital is for more than one night you will be charged for another night or be required to join a general ward.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Can I pre-book a Woodland Room?</h3>
              <p>It is not possible to book one of our amenity rooms in advance of the birth because your clinical condition and that of your baby will need to be assessed before a decision is made as to your suitability. However, once your suitability has been assessed please ask your midwife if there is a room available for you to use.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How will my birth experience impact on my suitability for a Woodland Room?</h3>
              <p>If you give birth by caesarean section or have experienced any complications either prior to, during, or following the birth of your baby you will need to be cared for in the ward area. This will also include if your baby requires any specific treatment or observations. Ask your midwife about your suitability to use a private room when you have given birth.</p>

              <p>Your partner will be offered breakfast in the room, and can access the tea and coffee making facilities. There is a coffee shop within the Jessop Wing for all other meals and snacks which your partner might want to purchase.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Can my other children stay?</h3>
              <p>We are sorry but other children cannot stay overnight in a Woodland Room. However, your children can visit you in the Room. If your partner is staying with you, please make arrangements for them to leave with a responsible adult at the end of vising time.</p>

              <p>As you would expect your partner will need to wear appropriate clothes while staying in the Woodlands Rooms, as staff will need to care for you during your stay and will be coming into the Rooms to do so. Please make sure you both bring in appropriate comfortable clothing.</p>
